                    <p class="starting-statment"> Have you ever wondered why so many people achieve things faster?  </p>
                    <p class='regular-statments'> 
                        While most people work all day and they don’t even get the time to spend with their family while some people enjoy the leisure to interact with their loved ones, they seem to have mastered the art of managing time.
                        In the past few months,
                        I have studied those people and found an astonishing conclusion, that had helped me in managing my time effectively and increasing my productivity.
                        What I am about to tell you can increase your productivity to ten times. 
                        I have always struggled with managing my time, I procrastinated, I was addicted to social media which has already cost me much.
                        But, I don’t want you to repeat the same mistake.
                        Don’t stress too much on perfection, focus on the progress.
                        I recently learned a simple law that can massively increase your productivity and save you time.
                        if you are like the old me who was too lazy and always used to procrastinate, then this law might help you to be super productive.
                        the law is known as the “Parkison’s law”
                    </p> 
                     <q class="quote"> Parkinson’s Law is the old adage that work expands to fill the time allotted
                     </q>

                       <p class="important-statment"> if you get do not set any deadlines for your goals or task your brain will think that you have infinite time to do the work 
                       </p>
                       <p class='regular-statments'> 
                        and hence it results in delay and procrastination. Therefore to get things done before the time you need to follow Parkinson's law, in other words, set specific time periods for your task to complete.
                        If you set a deadline for your task then you become even more productive and efficient.
